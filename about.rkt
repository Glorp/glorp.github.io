okay hi. yeah okay, let's make a bout

#:top
(require 2htdp/image
         lang/posn)

(define (filled f fill . args)
  (define pen (make-pen 'black 3 'solid 'round 'round))
  (overlay (apply f `(,@args outline ,pen))
           (apply f `(,@args solid ,fill))))

#:p
should help us make shapes with lines around them. let's test:

#:eval
(filled circle 'red 20)

#:p
this is fine.

#:top
(define bottom
  (filled polygon 'brown (list (make-posn 0 0)
                               (make-posn 200 0)
                               (make-posn 180 50)
                               (make-posn 30 50))))

#:eval
bottom

#:top
(define top (above/align 'right
                         (filled rectangle
                                 'darkgray
                                 20
                                 23)
                         (filled rectangle
                                 'red
                                 70
                                 50)))

#:eval
top

#:p
so we have top part of boat and bottom part of boat and we will make boat by putting top on *top* of bottom

#:top
(define boat (above top bottom))

#:p
now we just need the sea. the sea is made of blue

#:eval
(ellipse 70 40 'solid 'blue)
#:top
(define blue (ellipse 70 40 'solid 'blue))

(define sea (foldr (Î» (_ img) (overlay/xy blue 50 0 img))
                   blue
                   '(1 2 3 4)))
#:p
is it a boat ??

#:eval
(crop 10 0 250 130 (underlay/xy boat -40 95 sea))

#:p
is boat

okay,
